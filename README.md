# save-the-hospital
This project simulates hacking into hospital servers and now lives are in danger because medical information cannot be accessed.
With the project we got 5 encrypted files and a file called keys.
The project was divided into two parts. In the first part, I was able to decrypt three files using the script milestone2_7(which I wrote) 
in part one I found  129 emails of patients and wrote them in txt file.
In the second part of the project, work was done with log files I needed to use them to find out what suspicious scenarios occurred on the hospital network and then write ways in which you can avoid instances where such scenarios happen.
Part II of the project was also done by Python script(process analysis).
